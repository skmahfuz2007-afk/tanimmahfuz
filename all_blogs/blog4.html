  <summary>Morally Rejecting Morality! <small>Aug 17 2025</small></summary>
  <p>People look for “right ways” to do things, to make decisions, to live. But ya know… there’s not exactly any universal... “right way!"<br><br>But we do have a method for finding them. And it's easy. You just gotta define them first.<br><br>For example:<br><br>The more benefit something brings, the more “right” it is.<br><br>Or maybe: whatever causes less harm is more morally preferable.<br><br>Some say efficiency makes things right.<br><br>Others claim tradition determines righteousness.<br><br><br>Easy huh? But here's the hard part.<br><br>In reality, many people can’t define it that way. They can’t really explain what counts as an actual benefit—is it pleasure? Survival? Meaning? Power?<br><br>So they use this method to cope:<br><br>“Right and wrong are subjective. So I’ll just do what feels right.”<br><br>That’s a very modern approach—and yeah, it works. But in the long run, we get exhausted from constantly wondering whether a decision is right or wrong. And no, I’m not gonna offer a solution to that. Because we can only solve problems. And life’s not a problem.<br>Yet we try to solve it.<br>So do I.<br><br>Here’s a philosophy of mine:<br>What if the very concepts of meaning, morality, right, and wrong never existed in the first place?<br><br>Then you wouldn’t do things because they felt right.<br>You’d just do things. Period.<br><br>You might think my point is that “morality” doesn’t exist. But that’s not true either—they do exist, in our minds. That’s why they are called subjective.<br><br>But what if these moral frameworks were never natural to begin with?<br><br>Maybe some wise creatures from the past created this construct for practical reasons—controlling civilizations, keeping tribes together, maintaining social order, preventing chaos. And now it’s so deeply embedded in society, civilization, and maybe even in our biology that we can’t escape it.<br>We’re born into a world where “should” and “shouldn’t” are already carved into the language.<br><br>Without this concept of “right ways,” there’d be:<br><br>No anguish from searching for them<br><br>No guilt for choosing wrong<br><br>No paralysis from infinite options<br><br><br>I’m not saying morality made our lives worse. If anything, it might be the reason we became who we are today.<br>Without it, maybe we’d still be roaming like animals.<br><br>But then again—without morality, can you even say for sure that our lives are better than animals?<br><br>The wild part?<br>I might believe all this because I think it’s right.<br>And that’s just proof of how “moralities” are deeply rooted in our brains.<br><br>So, isn’t it like saying life doesn’t exist while living?<br>Not really!<br>It’s more like saying I wouldn’t have existed if I weren’t born.<br><br>"So, Tanim… what’s the point of this post anyway?"<br><br>Well… sometimes pointlessness is the point.<br><br>Here’s how it works for me:<br><br>> Conclusion = no conclusion<br>Life = happier<br><br><br><br>Now don’t ask me why living happily is the “right way”! xD</p>
