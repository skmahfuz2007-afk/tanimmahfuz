        This game doesnâ€™t care about your plans. Wanna slay dragons? Cool. Wanna rob villagers and live in a cave? Also cool. Skyrim is peak freedomâ€”like GTA but with swords, spells, and way more existential side quests. Youâ€™re not just playing a game, youâ€™re living a second life. Cheat codes? Built-in. Morality? Optional. Vibes? Immaculate.
